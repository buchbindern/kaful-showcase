## The problem

Most industrial equipment fails unpredictably. Predictive maintenance exists to solve this — but nearly every approach requires years of historical failure data to train on. Small and mid-sized manufacturers don't have that data. A new machine has no failure history. A one-off production line has no peer fleet to borrow from.

Meanwhile, the physics needed to model how a machine degrades is already written down. It's in the OEM manual, the datasheet, the service interval table. It's just locked in PDFs.

## What Kaful does

Kaful automatically generates a **physics-grounded prognostic digital twin** for rotating industrial equipment directly from OEM documentation — without requiring historical failure data.

Given a machine's technical manuals, Kaful:

1. Extracts component specs, degradation physics, and failure modes using retrieval-grounded LLM extraction
2. Constructs a physics-based simulation of the machine's degradation over time
3. Runs a particle filter over the simulation to produce a **RUL probability range** — not a single number, but a calibrated uncertainty estimate

The result is a component-level failure forecast a maintenance engineer can act on, generated from documentation that already exists.

## Architecture

![Kaful agentic pipeline](assets/architecture.png)

The pipeline runs as an **agentic system** — seven autonomous stages, each feeding the next, with no human intervention per document:

| Stage | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Ingest** | OEM PDFs are chunked, embedded, and indexed for retrieval |
| **Schema extract** | RAG + LLM pulls component specs, tolerances, and service intervals |
| **Simulate** | Physics-based degradation model is constructed from extracted specs |
| **Comprehend** | LLM reviews the simulation against known failure modes from the manual |
| **Triage** | Failure paths are ranked by severity and likelihood |
| **Codegen** | ProgPy degradation model is auto-generated from the triage output |
| **Prognose** | Particle filter runs over the model; outputs RUL probability range per component |

The agentic framing is deliberate: the goal is zero manual configuration per machine type. Point Kaful at a new OEM manual and it generates a twin.

## Demo — Atlas Copco GA90C Air Compressor

The GA90C is a 90kW rotary screw industrial air compressor, a common fixture in manufacturing plants. Kaful ingested the Atlas Copco GA55-90C instruction book and Compressed Air Manual (9th edition) and produced component-level RUL forecasts across three usage profiles — with no GA90C failure data used at any point.

### RUL dashboard (three usage profiles)

![RUL dashboard](assets/dashboard.png)

The same compressor, the same OEM manual, three completely different risk profiles depending on how it's operated:

- **Continuous / industrial** — nearly all components triggered or imminent; air filter at 2 hrs, air cooler at 7 hrs
- **Moderate / commercial** — mixed picture; air filter at ~400 hrs, several components already triggered
- **Light / intermediate** — longest horizon; air filter at ~3,300 hrs, Elektronikon service warning at ~5,200 hrs

Each forecast includes a **particle filter uncertainty range** (min/max across the ensemble), not just a point estimate. The width of that range reflects the physics of the component — a condensate trap float valve has a wider uncertainty band than an oil stop valve because its degradation is more sensitive to operating variability.

### Sample predictions (light / intermediate profile)

| Component | RUL mean (hrs) | Range (hrs) | Std |
|---|---|---|---|
| Elektronikon · service warning | 5,202 | 5,202–5,203 | 0.5 |
| Oil cooler · condensate formation | 5,066 | 4,730–5,287 | 136 |
| Drive motor · incorrect rotation | 4,193 | 4,058–4,318 | 69 |
| Oil stop valve · jammed | 4,169 | 4,068–4,262 | 52 |
| Oil separator element · clogged | 4,159 | 4,052–4,334 | 63 |
| Inlet valve · stuck open | 3,518 | 3,026–5,019 | 327 |
| Air filter · choked | 3,294 | 3,013–3,453 | 73 |
| Condensate trap · flexible clogged | 3,292 | 3,096–3,398 | 74 |
| Inlet valve · safety valve blow | 1,602 | 1,496–1,741 | 62 |
| Condensate trap · float valve | 241 | 140–306 | 37 |
| Air cooler · condensate | 1 | 1–1 | 0 |
